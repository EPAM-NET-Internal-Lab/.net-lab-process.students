# How tasks are graded

Good coding skills are for sure necessary to get good results, but often they can't be considered as the only source of truth during the final verdict.

Also as a specialist which will work inside team collaboration and learning abilities will be also appreciated.
Having said that here is the criteria which will be considered during the grading:

|Criterion|Meet Expectations|Exceeded Expectations|
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
|**Task Requirements**|All requirements are met, all required features are implemented. All of it **before the task deadline**.|Everything in "Meet Expectations" + all optional features are implemented|
|**Software Design**|The student follows the best programming practices: SOLID, DRY, YAGNI. Uses OOP correctly: applies inheritance and encapsulation, uses different access modifiers.|Everything in "Meet Expectations" + student tends to actively apply knowledge from lectures into practice, uses advanced language features frequently and correctly: generics, LINQ, TPL(able to write asynchronous and multi-threaded code). Able to keep solution in good shape during the course of all tasks: refactor old code and strive for high code coverage with tests.|
|**Software Development Process**|The student is able to follow a defined workflow process. Commits and pushes changes to the repository in a correct branch, able to create pull-request and issues in GitHub. During development used solution template from documentation with code analysis applied.|Everything in "Meet Expectations" + student has good commit history: frequent and regular commits, with a good description. During the review stage tries to fix issues and code review remarks as fast as possible, collaborates with the reviewer, helps other students in the main chat in case of questions and problems.|

If all points from "Meet Expectations" are completed you may get a high mark. If you complete the "Exceeded Expectations" column you may get additional recognition.
